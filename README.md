# AnkiToPDFAddon
Anki addon to generate a texbook out of your deck 

Still a project 

It transforms the deck into a LaTeX document. 
- In the settings section next to every deck you get a "export PDF" button 
- The deck chosen is the title for the LaTeX document 
- Every subdeck is a subsection 
- It comes with a default specification for every note type
- For each note type you can specify how you want it to look like
- If the note contains the tag "noPDF" it gets ignored
